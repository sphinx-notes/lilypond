.. warning:: This release introduces some BREAKING changes.

- **BREAKING** changes:

  - Drop ``:noheader``, ``:nofooter:`` options. User should modifying their Lilypond
    source to removing header and footer of scores, see `Custom titles headers and footers`__
    for more details (:issue:`35`)
  - Drop ``:noedge:`` option and introduce ``:nocrop:`` with opposite meaning compared to before.
    It is said that score is croppped (noedge) by default
    By the way, dependencies to Wand and ImageMagick are dropped (:issue:`31`)
  - Drop ``:audio:`` option and introduce ``:noaudio:`` with opposite meaning compared to before.
    Audio will be auto-generated when any `MIDI output`__ avaliable, and user set `:noaudio:`
    only when they don't need this behavior (:pull:`36`)

- Enhanced Jianpu support (:issue:`30`)

  - Don't panic when Jianpu parsing failed
  - Can display multiple Jianpu scores, see also `jianpu-ly#35`__
  - Audio works fine now

- Score image generataion is reproducible now (:issue:`10`)
